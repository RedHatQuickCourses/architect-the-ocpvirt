= Current Environment

The Red Hat team asked a few questions from previous section, specific to the company's current environment to get an idea of their existing infrastructure. Financial companyâ€™s infrastructure consists of more than 75,000 virtual machines (VMs) distributed across data centers in seven countries.

* These VMs can be categorized into four main types:
** Production: 28,000 VMs
** Non-production: 31,000 VMs
** Management: 8,000 VMs
** Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI): 6,000 VMs

Approximately 19,000 VMs are under the responsibility of the Operations and Infrastructure (O&I) team while the remaining VMs are owned by various product teams within the organization. Out of 75,000 VMs, 69,000 VMs can be potentially migrated to a new platform.
