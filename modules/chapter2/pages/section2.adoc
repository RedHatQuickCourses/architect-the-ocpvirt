= Pilot Foundation

//Suggest we adjust the copy to stay with our narrative. Not sure if the following copy will work:
After the migration assessment, Red Hat and the financial firm created a pilot. The pilot, the outline of which can be seen below, lays out the pathway for migration by preparing infrastructure, evaluating workloads, developing procedures, and providing training.
//It is not clear who is being referred to when we say "Then we execute..." What about something like the following:
The next step is for the client to execute the migration of an initial batch of VMs that exercise the strategies, automation, and procedural approach.

== Workstreams and Tasks

== Outputs
//Made small copy edits.
* One lab environment (carried over from PoT)
* Non-production environment
* One to three datacenters with production environments
