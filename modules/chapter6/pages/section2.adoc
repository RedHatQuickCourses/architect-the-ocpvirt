= Raw Capacity Required for Workloads

To set the stage for the remainder of the example, letâ€™s identify a desired workload.
The customer wants to host these many VMs:

* 1000 small = 1000 vCPU, 4000GiB. Plus 228 GiB memory overhead.
* 300 medium = 600 vCPU, 2400GiB. Plus 73 GiB memory overhead.
* 200 large = 800 vCPU, 4800GiB. Plus 58 GiB memory overhead.
* 200 x-large = 1600 vCPU, 9600GiB. Plus 64 GiB memory overhead.

This brings us to a total of *1700 VMs* using *4000 vCPUs* and *20800 GiB memory*, plus *423 GiB* overhead.
The average VM will have *2.4 vCPUs* and use *12.5 GiB memory*, which is a convenient way of estimating capacity for nodes.
