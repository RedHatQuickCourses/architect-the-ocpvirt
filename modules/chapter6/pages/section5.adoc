= Adjust for failover/HA and resource balancing

We factored in the size of the failure domain above, however we have not taken into account how to accommodate that capacity in the event of a failure scenario - or even when taking nodes offline for, for example, cluster updates and upgrades.
With a *12 node cluster*, each node represents 8% of cluster capacity, so we need to accommodate for *8 * #_of_node_failures worth of capacity* to be rescheduled in the surviving nodes.

* Tolerating one node failing would limit hosts to *92% maximum utilization*.
* *Two-node tolerance* would limit hosts to *83%*.
* *Three-node tolerance* would limit hosts to *75%*.

Furthermore, we want to prevent things like out-of-memory conditions.
When to trigger evictions will depend on a number of factors, most importantly we want to set the value low enough where soft evictions will have time to happen before hard evictions and/or any actions are taken by the OOM_kill process.
A secondary consideration is that the soft eviction will also become the threshold where a nodeâ€™s workload triggers rescheduling for things like resource balancing as well.

Depending on the size of the nodes, the size of the VMs, and the length of time to live migrate virtual machines, it may make sense to have the *soft eviction threshold* set anywhere between *85% - 98%*.
Splitting this down the middle for our example, if we choose *92% memory utilization* on servers with *2 TiB of memory*, that would trigger soft evictions (i.e., live migrations) for VMs when the host has approximately *160 GiB of free memory* remaining.
This may or may not be enough for the workload and would need to be monitored and adjusted over time.

However, for the sake of sizing, we can now assume that for a *12-node cluster* where we want to tolerate two nodes failing with a *soft eviction threshold of 8%* remaining capacity, we can math out that we are increasing overall resource requirements by *24% (16% for node failover capacity, 8% for eviction)*.
This means we would want to increase the node count by *24%, 12 + (12 * .24) = 15 nodes* total.
