= Physical Cluster Design

In the absence of known sizing for compute and storage resources, Red Hat recommends using a modular approach to node sizing based on the expected initial capacity requirements, with the ability to scale up to 100+ hypervisor nodes in a single OpenShift deployment. OpenShift Virtualization supports many different node and cluster configurations. 
//The phrase "In the absence of known sizing" is used twice. Suggest a different formulation for the second instance. I suggest something like this:
The sizing below represents a starting point for an OpenShift deployment where the sizing for compute and storage resources is not known; 
// The following clause may not be clear (it isn't to me). Is it saying something like "however, if your requirements are known, node sizes and configurations should be tailored as needed."?
however, node sizes and configurations should be tailored to meet your requirements as needed.

Here is a graphical representation of the different node types as part of this solution:
