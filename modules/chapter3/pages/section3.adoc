= Micro Cluster

* This cluster size is comprised of:
** A three (3) node OpenShift cluster
** Control plane running on three (3) nodes
** Storage and compute running on all three (3) nodes with compute
** Example node size:
*** CPU: 64 cores
*** Memory: 512GiB
*** OS Disks: 2x512GB (RAID1)
*** Cluster Storage (ODF): 2x 8TB NVMe/SSD disks
*** Network: 6x 25Gb NICs
** The resulting cluster has 342 vCPU (with 4:1 overcommit), 826GiB memory, and 10.4TB storage available for workloads.
*** 34% of compute and memory capacity is reserved for HA
*** 10% of compute capacity is reserved for spare/burst
*** The suggested storage capacity above reflects 65% of the capacity used

[NOTE]
The financial companyâ€™s Proof of Technology (PoT) environment fits in this Micro cluster category.

The high-level design for the micro form factor cluster would look like the following:
