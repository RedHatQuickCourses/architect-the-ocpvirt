= Medium Cluster

* This cluster size is comprised of:
** Fifteen (15) node OpenShift cluster
** Control plane + compute running on three (3) nodes
** Storage running on three (3) nodes with compute
** Additional nine (9) nodes of “just” compute
** Example node size:
*** CPU: 64 cores
*** Memory: 512GiB
*** OS Disks: 2x512GB (RAID1)
*** Cluster Storage (ODF): 8x 8TB NVMe/SSD disks
*** Network: 6x 25Gb NICs
** The resulting cluster has 2345 vCPU, 5177GiB memory, and 41.6 TB storage available for workloads.
*** 10% of compute and memory capacity is reserved for HA
*** 10% of compute capacity is reserved for spare/burst
*** The suggested storage capacity above reflects 65% of the capacity used

The resulting cluster has three node types (compute, compute + storage, compute + control plane) which contribute capacity for hosting virtual machines in addition to their shared purpose (ODF or control plane).

Here is a high-level design for the medium form factor cluster:
